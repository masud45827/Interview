# what is data redundancy?
Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places, whereas data inconsistency is when the same data exists in different formats in multiple tables.

# what is data inconsistency?
there are more than 2 tables within a database that work with the same data but receive it from different inputs.aikhane 2 ta table a salary ar name ache. to 2 table a akoi name er salary different atakei data inconsistency bole.

# what is Normalization?
it is used to remove or reduce the redundency from a relation
# difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
DBMS can be Structure or untructured data.but RDBMS must be structure data.
DBMS supports varius storage in various formats.RDBMS organizes data in tabular format with row and column
